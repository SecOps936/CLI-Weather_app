## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Frontend: The user interface is built with HTML5 for structure,
CSS3 for styling and layout, Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and pre-built components, and 
TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development.

Backend: The server is built with Node.js and Express.js, which handles requests from the frontend. 
The backend also uses node-fetch to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API securely, so the API key is not exposed to the frontend.

Development Tools: We use npm for dependency management and scripts, 
TypeScript compiler (tsc) to convert .ts files into .js, and lite-server to run a lightweight frontend server with live reload during development.

Data: The app fetches JSON data from OpenWeatherMap API and parses it to show meaningful information like temperature, city name, and weather description.
